# Sustainable Tech Wellington

## Vision

Sustainable Tech Wellington is committed to inspiring and empowering Wellingtonians to take meaningful and measurable action to mitigate the effects of climate change. We envision a future where individuals, communities and organizations come together to create a more sustainable and equitable world through education, advocacy and collective action. We aim to create an inclusive and collaborative environment that celebrates diversity and encourages innovation and creativity in our collective efforts to combat climate change.

## Mission

A social group which is dedicated to empowering individuals to take meaningful action towards creating a more sustainable and equitable future. Through education, collaboration, and advocacy, we strive to create a community in Wellington that is passionate about protecting our environment and creating positive change. We believe we have the power to make a difference and that we can create a world that is healthier and more equitable for everyone.

## Objectives

1. Increase awareness of climate change and how it affects our environment.
2. Educate members on sustainable practices and how they can reduce their carbon footprint.
3. Promote and organize events that encourage members to reduce their carbon emissions.
4. Develop a network of members that can collaborate and share resources to further their efforts.
5. Connect members with opportunities to advocate climate related initiatives in their community.

## Notes

Good tech, bad tech. Technology can solve some environmental problems, but it can also create others. The Tech Sector is a community, and we would like to get together to socialise, share info, and represent ourselves at other climate action events.

Social gatherings, presentations and resource sharing.
